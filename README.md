### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

I've been working with web development since 2018. I develop applications that impact more than a hundred thousand users. Always concerned with the user experience and the scalability of apps. I worked in multidisciplinary teams where I had the opportunity to help improve development processes and implement new features.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Software Engineer at [CWI Software](https://www.cwi.com.br/)
- ðŸš€ My main stack is Typescript and React, but I easily learn and adapt to other technologies
- âš¡ In my free time I've been studying and practicing ReScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ggrigotti@gmail.com
